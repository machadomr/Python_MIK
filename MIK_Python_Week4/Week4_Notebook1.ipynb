    "All programs need the input to process and output to display data, for that we use `files`. You can picture that as a storage compartments on computers that are managed by your OS. Variables also provide us a way to store data, however only while our program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will primarily focus on opening, reading and writing text on files such as those we create in a text editor. Later we will see how to work with database files which are binary files, specifically designed to be read and written through database software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening files\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to `read` or `write` a file (say on your hard drive), we first must `open` the file. Opening the file communicates with your operating system, which knows where the data for each file is stored. When you open a file, you are asking the operating system to find the file by name and make sure the file exists. In this example, we open the file `mbox.txt`, which should be stored in the same folder as this notebook."
